Calculate The Room

The challenge is to write a program that takes as input the dimensions of a room and outputs the following:


Area of the floor
Amount of paint required to paint the walls
Volume of the room

Upon reading this challenge i saw it as an opportunity to refresh my programming ability with java. 

This tree structure will be used to help me work through the program in an organized fashion allowing me to go back and re-check what steps need to be covered.
